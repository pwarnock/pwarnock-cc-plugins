# Context Health

## Overview

Quality rubrics and evaluation methodology for codified context infrastructure. Use this to assess whether your context documents are serving their purpose and identify improvement opportunities.

A context infrastructure that exists but is inaccurate or stale can be worse than no infrastructure — it actively misleads the AI agent. Regular health evaluation catches drift before it becomes a problem.

## Quick Health Check (5-minute version)

Run through these five questions to get a rough health score:

1. Does `.claude/context/constitution.md` exist and have all 10 sections filled in?
   - All 10 sections, all non-placeholder content: **10 points**
   - Exists but sections are incomplete or contain template placeholders: **5 points**
   - Missing: **0 points**

2. Does `trigger-tables.md` have routes for your main source directories?
   - Routes covering >80% of source directories: **5 points**
   - Some routes, partial coverage: **2-3 points**
   - Missing or no routes: **0 points**

3. Does `failure-modes.md` have entries from recent debugging sessions?
   - 5+ entries across multiple categories: **5 points**
   - 2-4 entries: **2-3 points**
   - Empty or missing: **0 points**

4. Does `subsystem-map.md` cover all major directories?
   - All source directories mapped with boundary sections: **5 points**
   - Major directories mapped: **2-3 points**
   - Missing or mostly empty: **0 points**

5. Do `specs/` exist for your most-changed subsystems?
   - Specs exist for high-churn subsystems: **5 points**
   - Some specs, not the high-churn ones: **2-3 points**
   - No specs: **0 points**

**Total: /30**

Map to health rating:
- 27-30: Excellent
- 21-26: Good
- 15-20: Fair
- 9-14: Poor
- 0-8: Critical

## Detailed Quality Assessment

For a thorough evaluation, score each document against the rubrics in `references/coverage-criteria.md`. The rubrics cover:

- **Constitution quality** — per-section scoring with Complete / Partial / Missing ratings and section weights
- **Trigger table effectiveness** — coverage breadth, pattern specificity, rationale completeness, freshness
- **Failure mode completeness** — entry count, field completeness, specificity, category coverage, lifecycle maintenance
- **Subsystem map accuracy** — directory coverage, boundary documentation, spec linkage, hot area tracking

## Health Scoring

| Score | Rating | Interpretation |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| 90-100 | Excellent | Context infrastructure is comprehensive and current |
| 70-89 | Good | Core documents solid, some gaps in coverage or freshness |
| 50-69 | Fair | Foundational docs exist but need significant enrichment |
| 30-49 | Poor | Major gaps — several core documents missing or very stale |
| 0-29 | Critical | Context infrastructure barely exists — run bootstrap setup |

---

## Improvement Priorities

When the health check reveals gaps, address them in this order:

1. **Missing core files** — Create them, even minimal versions. The paper's guideline G1 ("a basic constitution does heavy lifting") applies here: even a minimal constitution is dramatically better than none. Run through the bootstrap setup guide from `codified-context-patterns`.

2. **Broken references** — Links in the constitution that point to non-existent spec files, or trigger table routes pointing to missing context documents. Fix immediately — broken references cause the AI to fail silently.

3. **Stale build commands** — Build commands that no longer work are the most immediately damaging stale content. The AI will run them and fail. Verify every command in §4 actually executes successfully.

4. **Undocumented active subsystems** — Write specs for high-churn subsystems first. The areas you change most frequently have the highest leverage for improvement. Check git log to identify high-churn directories.

5. **Incomplete failure modes** — Add entries from recent debugging sessions. If you can recall debugging anything in the last month that took more than 30 minutes, it probably belongs in failure-modes.md.

6. **Routing gaps** — Add trigger table entries for file patterns and keywords that you find yourself repeatedly context-switching around. If you're loading the same spec manually every time you work in a directory, add the route.

7. **Quality improvements** — Fill in missing fields in failure mode entries (especially the Prevention column), add rationale to trigger table rows that lack it, update last-reviewed dates.

## Maintenance Cadence

**Every 2 weeks**: Review failure modes. Remove entries where the root cause has been permanently fixed (move to the Archived section). Add entries from any debugging sessions since the last review.

**Monthly**: Check tech stack versions in §2 against your actual installed versions. Verify build commands in §4 still work. Versions drift, commands change, package managers update.

**After major refactors**: Review the architecture summary in §5 and the trigger tables in §8. Structural changes to the codebase mean routing rules may be pointing at moved or deleted directories.

**After onboarding new agents or skills**: Update the trigger tables. New agents/skills should have routing entries so the AI knows when to invoke them.
